**Notional is a free, open-source Obsidian plugin for two-way Obsidian ↔ Notion sync.** It's the missing bridge between the app where you *think* and the apps where your team — and your AI — *work*. Draft in the speed and privacy of Obsidian, then send polished, fully‑formatted pages to Notion in one click — links intact, structure preserved, nothing overwritten by surprise.

And because Notion is where AI agents like **Claude, ChatGPT, and OpenClaw** can read and write your knowledge, Notional doubles as the pipe that turns your private Obsidian vault into an **AI-ready second brain** — on your terms, with nothing leaving your device but the notes you choose.

## The problem you already know too well

You live in Obsidian. It's fast, it's private, it's *yours*. But the rest of the world lives in Notion — your clients, your teammates, your shared wikis.

So you copy. You paste. And it falls apart:

- 🔗 Your `[[wiki-links]]` turn into dead plain text.
- 📐 Your nested outlines flatten into mush.
- 👯 You end up with stale duplicates and no idea which one is current.
- 😤 You do it all again next week.

**Notional ends the copy‑paste tax.** One command, and your note lands in Notion looking the way it should.

---

## What it feels like

> You finish a note in Obsidian. You hit **Push**. Seconds later it's a clean Notion page your client can read — headings, checklists, tables, callouts, and your internal links converted into real Notion page mentions. You keep writing in Obsidian. Notion stays in sync. You never touch the clipboard.

---

## Notional for AI agents

> **The short version:** Obsidian is where you (and local AI agents) *write*. Notion is where AI agents can *read*. Notional connects them — so your notes power Claude, ChatGPT, and friends without you copy-pasting into a chat box ever again.

Today's AI assistants split along one line. **Local agents** — Claude Code, Hermes, Cursor — read and write the plain Markdown in your vault directly. **Cloud agents** — OpenClaw, plus the Notion connectors and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations now built into Claude and ChatGPT — reach your knowledge through Notion's API. Obsidian has no official cloud API; Notion does. **Notional is the bridge that lets both sides work from the same source of truth.**

- 🧠 **Turn your vault into an AI-readable second brain.** Push the folders you choose to Notion, and any Notion-aware agent (Claude, ChatGPT, OpenClaw, or a custom MCP client) can instantly search, summarize, and cite your notes — without you ever exposing your whole vault. Scoped, folder-level publishing means *you* decide exactly what the AI can see.
- 📥 **Close the mobile capture loop.** A Discord or Telegram agent dumps research, links, and ideas into Notion while you're away from your desk; **Pull** brings them home into the vault where you do deep work. Draft on desktop, push to Notion, then chat with the same notes from your phone.
- 🤖 **Publish what your AI writes.** Let Claude Code or Hermes draft research, summaries, and outlines as Markdown in Obsidian, then Notional pushes them to Notion as clean, formatted pages your team — or your *next* agent — can act on. Markdown stays the source of truth, and you **Pull** the AI's edits back when you're ready.
- 📊 **Feed structured data to analysis agents.** Keep journals, trackers, and tables as Markdown in your vault, push them into a Notion database, and point a read-only AI agent at it for pattern-finding — a trade journal, a reading log, an experiment tracker. You keep authorship in Obsidian; the agent just reads.
- 🛟 **Safe by default when agents edit.** If an AI changes a page in Notion *and* you've changed the same note locally, Notional stops and asks instead of silently overwriting — so handing pages to autonomous agents never quietly costs you work. Credentials stay on your device; there's no Notional server in the loop.

> 💡 **Why route AI through Notion at all?** Your Obsidian vault lives on disk with no shared cloud endpoint. Notion gives it a clean, permissioned API that every major AI agent already speaks — so Notional lets you grant AI access to a *slice* of your knowledge instead of all-or-nothing local file access.

## Who it's for

**🧑‍💼 The consultant**
You draft rough, honest notes in private — then your client expects a tidy Notion page. Push selected notes (or a whole project folder) straight to their workspace. Obsidian stays your backstage; Notion is the polished stage.

**🔬 The researcher**
Your vault is a web of linked ideas. Notional turns those wiki-links into clickable Notion **page mentions** and preserves your deep nesting — so your research becomes a real, navigable team knowledge base instead of a flat copy-paste dump.

**🗓️ The team lead**
Meeting notes start as fast local typing during the call. One click later they're a shared Notion doc your team can act on — and follow-up edits keep flowing.

**🛠️ The builder**
Specs and docs are faster to write in Markdown, but review and discovery happen in Notion. Keep your Markdown the source of truth, let the team comment in Notion, and **pull their changes back** when you're ready.

**📣 The publisher**
You want to share *part* of your vault, not expose every file path. Notional's scoped, folder-level publishing keeps you in control of exactly what goes public.

**🤖 The AI tinkerer**
You run Claude, ChatGPT, or a custom agent against Notion and want it grounded in *your* notes — not the open web. Sync the relevant folders and your agent gets a curated, always-current knowledge base, while you keep writing in Obsidian. See [Notional for AI agents](#notional-for-ai-agents).

## Why you can trust it with your notes

Most sync tools make you nervous because you never know what they'll overwrite. Notional is built to be the opposite — **calm, predictable, and honest:**

- 🛟 **Never silently overwrites.** If both sides changed, Notional *stops and asks you* which version to keep. No surprise data loss, ever.
- 🔎 **Always inspectable.** The link between a note and its Notion page lives in plain front matter you can read. No black box.
- 🎛️ **You're in control.** Sync happens when *you* say so (automatic mode is strictly opt-in).
- 🔐 **Private by design.** With one-click connect, your credentials and tokens stay on *your device* and talk only to Notion — there's no Notional server in the middle, ever.

## Get started in ~3 minutes

### 1. Install

**Easiest:** open Obsidian → **Settings → Community plugins → Browse**, search **“Notional”**, Install, then Enable.

<details>
<summary>Other install options</summary>

Via [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) (for early updates):

```text
bryanbans/Notional
```

Or manually from the [latest release](https://github.com/bryanbans/Notional/releases) into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/notional/` (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`), then reload Obsidian.
</details>

### 2. Connect your Notion

Open **Settings → Notional** and pick whichever path you like:

**Option A — Paste a token (fastest)**
1. Create a connection at [notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) and copy its secret.
2. Paste it into **Notion API token**, then click **Test**.

**Option B — One-click “Connect with Notion” (OAuth)**
1. At [notion.so/profile/integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) → **New connection → OAuth**.
2. Set the redirect URI to `https://bryanbans.github.io/Notional/oauth-callback.html`.
3. Copy the **client ID** and **client secret** into **Advanced → OAuth**.
4. Click **Connect with Notion**, approve the pages to share, and you're in — your secret never leaves your device.

**Then, point it at a home for your notes:**
1. Share a Notion page with your connection.
2. Paste that page's link into Notional and click **Create notes database** — Notional builds the database for you.

### 3. Sync your first note

Open any note and **Push** it (ribbon icon, the **Open sync panel** command, or the command palette). After that first push the note is linked — use **Sync** from then on for the safe, timestamp-aware path.

---

## Everything you can do

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Upload current note to Notion** | Publishes the note you're in |
| **Upload current folder to Notion** | Publishes a whole project folder at once |
| **Pull current note from Notion** | Brings teammates' Notion edits back into Obsidian |
| **Sync current note with Notion** | Picks the right direction automatically |
| **Open sync panel** | One-click control center for the active note |

**The sync panel** is your at-a-glance cockpit: linked status, last-synced and last-edited times, change indicators on both sides, one-click Push / Pull / Sync, a recent-activity log, and — when both sides changed — a clear choice between **Keep local** and **Keep Notion**. No guessing.

<summary><strong>Under the hood</strong> (for the curious / contributors)</summary>

### How sync works

1. A note links to a Notion page via YAML front matter.
2. **Push** converts Markdown → Notion blocks (via Martian), appending deeply nested blocks past Notion's per-call limit.
3. **Pull** converts supported Notion blocks back into Markdown.
4. **Sync** chooses a direction from stored timestamps.
5. If both sides changed, it pauses and asks — never an automatic merge.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Obsidian Markdown"] --> B["Front matter parser"]
  B --> C["Wiki-link resolver"]
  C --> D["Martian Markdown -> Notion blocks"]
  D --> E["Recursive Notion append"]
  E --> F["Notion page"]

  F --> G["Notion block reader"]
  G --> H["Block -> Markdown converter"]
  H --> I["Conflict-aware file update"]
  I --> A
```

Sync state is stored in each note's front matter, so the link travels with the file:

```yaml
notionPageId: ...
notionPageUrl: ...
notionLastEditedTime: ...
obsidianLastSyncedAt: ...
```

### Code map

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `main.ts` | Plugin lifecycle, commands, scoped folder upload, OAuth, autosync |
| `view.ts` | Sync side panel and conflict actions |
| `settingTab.ts` | Connection and setup UI |
| `service/index.ts` | Upload, pull, sync orchestration |
| `service/notion.ts` | Notion REST calls and block conversion |
| `service/oauth.ts` | OAuth URL + token exchange (direct, secret stays local) |
| `service/utils.ts` | Front matter, wiki-link parsing, URL helpers |
| `service/types.ts` | Shared settings and sync result types |

### Good to know

- Pull covers common blocks: paragraphs, headings, lists, to-dos, quotes, code, dividers, images, tables, callouts, toggles, equations, and media links.
- Unsupported blocks are flagged with a `> [!missing]` callout — never dropped silently.
- Automatic sync (opt-in) is scoped to the open note; conflicts are always deferred to the panel.
- Conflict handling is side-based; there's no line-level merge UI yet.

## FAQ

**How do I sync Obsidian with Notion?**
Install Notional from Obsidian's **Community plugins → Browse** (search “Notional”), connect your Notion workspace with an API token or one-click OAuth, then use the **Push**, **Pull**, and **Sync** commands on any note. Notional converts Markdown to Notion blocks and keeps both sides in sync.

**Does Notional do true two-way sync, or just export to Notion?**
True two-way. Push Markdown notes to Notion *and* pull Notion edits back into Obsidian. When both sides changed, it asks you which version to keep instead of guessing.

**Is Notional free and open source?**
Yes — completely free, released under GPL v3.0, with full source on GitHub.

**What happens to my `[[wiki-links]]` and nested notes?**
Wiki-links become clickable Notion **page mentions**, and deeply nested outlines upload past Notion's per-call block limit, so your structure survives.

**Is my data private?**
Yes. Notional runs entirely on your device; your notes and Notion token go directly from your machine to the Notion API — never to a third-party server. See the [privacy policy](https://bryanbans.github.io/Notional/privacy.html).

**Can I use Notional with AI agents like Claude, ChatGPT, or OpenClaw?**
Yes — that's a sweet spot. Local agents (Claude Code, Hermes) work directly on your Obsidian Markdown, while cloud agents reach knowledge through Notion's API. Notional syncs the two, so you can publish AI-drafted notes from Obsidian to Notion, expose a scoped slice of your vault as an agent-readable "second brain," and pull agent edits back — without silent overwrites. See [Notional for AI agents](#notional-for-ai-agents).

**How is Notional different from Nobsidion / obsidian-to-notion?**
Notional is an actively maintained continuation with one-click OAuth connect, a conflict-aware sync panel, folder-level publishing, and timestamp-based Pull/Sync. See [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) for lineage.
